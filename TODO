@TODO

- Some improvements to xdmf output needed:
  It would be a bit better to uniquify the vertices in 
  xdmf output, at the moment there are redundant points

- Solution should be pssibly be saved...
  as a 1 to 4 column file, might be quite useful as an 
  additional option instead of separate files

- Add numerous sanity checks!
  Everything is somewhat unstable at the moment, add 
  warnings etc, when parameters are chosen incorrectly   

- Post-processing module needs to be extended!
  Variance reduction for data subgroups, logarithmic
  likeliehood, and normalized model roughness

- Read models for synthetic tests as point clouds
  and automatically project onto inversion grid,
  and a routine computing checkerboard models
  and build routine that adds random noise

- Module to compute resolution matrix

- Compare solvers and their convergence

- Variance reduction hypothesis tests
